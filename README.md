# parallel-asynchronous-programming-java
## Description
This course is structured to give you the theoretical and coding experience writing parallel and asynchronous code using ParallelStreams and CompletableFuture. You will become very Fluent in writing Asynchronous/Parallel Code in Java once you complete this course.

If you are looking forward to writing High Performant Java code then this is the right course for you. This course covers the latest features that are available in Modern Java that helps you write fast performing code.

This course explicitly covers the following APIs in Modern Java:

- ParallelStreams

- CompletableFuture

### Getting Started with Parallel and Asynchronous programming

In this section, I will explain about the need to learn about the Parallel and Asynchronous programming concepts in todays software development

Briefly talks about the Evolution of Concurrency APIs in Java

Explain about the difference between the Concurrency and Parallelism

### Course Project SetUp

In this section, we will set up the base project for the whole course.

###Threads, Future, ForkJoin FrameWork, and its Limitations

In this section, I will explain about Threads, Future API, ForkJoin FrameWork and its limitations

I will show a demonstration of all these concepts using code examples.

The limitations that are covered in the course sets the stage for ParallelStreams and CompletableFuture API

### Getting started with Parallel Streams

In this section, I will introduce you all to parallel streams and implement a simple example using Parallel Streams

Introduction to Streams API and ParallelStreams

Implement a simple example using ParallelStreams 

Write unit tests to test the ParallelStreams using JUnit5

### Build Retail Checkout Application using Parallel Streams

In this section, we will build a simple Backend Retail Checkout application using Parallel Streams

### Parallel Streams - Under the hood

In this section, I will cover the internals of parallel streams.

I will explain about how ParallelStreams work under the hood

Compare the performance of different collections when it's used against the ParallelStreams

Usage of Collect vs Reduce terminal operators in Streams API and Parallel Streams

Operators that can cause poor performance when it's used against ParallelStreams

### Parallel Streams - Threading Model & Common ForkJoin Pool

In this section, I will explain about the execution engine behind the parallel Streams

Covers the Threading model that's utilized behind the scenes by ParallelStreams

Configuring the ThreadPool for Faster Performance

### Parallel Streams - Summary

This section summarizes everything that's discussed above that's related to ParallelStreams

Covers the scenarios on "when to use/when not to use" ParallelStreams

### CompletableFuture

In this section, I will introduce you all to the CompletableFuture API

### Exploring CompletableFuture Functions

In this section, I will code and explore the functions that are part of the CompletableFuture API

Explore some of the key functions that are part of the CompletableFuture API

Write unit tests to test the CompletableFuture using JUnit5

### Build a ProductService application using CompletableFuture

In this section, we will implement the ProductService example using CompletableFuture

This section will give you all an idea about how to use CompletableFuture in a real-world scenario

### Combining Streams and CompletableFuture

In this section, I will show you the techniques to combine Streams with CompletableFuture.

I will explore this by adding an enhancement to the ProductService which is the InventoryService

Explore the different options available to integrate Streams API with CompletableFuture

### Exception Handling/Recovery in CompletableFuture

In this section, I will introduce you to to the techniques/options that are to handle/recover exceptions using CompletableFuture

I will explain and cover different exception handling and recovery techniques that are available in CompletableFuture

handle()

exceptionally()

whenComplete

I will compare and explain the difference of behaviors between them and provide recommendation on using different handlers for different use cases.

### Implement Exception Handling/Recovery in ProductService

In this lecture, I will show you techniques to implement the exception handling techniques in our ProductService

Implement the exception handling and recovery technique in  ProductInfoService, ReviewService and  InventoryService

### CompletableFuture & ThreadPool

In this section, I will cover the ThreadPool and the different options that are available to use with CompletableFuture

I will cover the default CommonForkJoin ThreadPool thats used to execute the CompletableFuture

I will cover the techniques to use a Custom ThreadPool that can be used to execute the CompletableFuture

### Threads and Async Overloaded Methods in CompletableFuture

I will cover the threads that are used to execute CompletableFuture

I will show the technique to use Async() methods that's part of the CompletableFuture API to change the execution of threads in the CompletableFuture Pipeline

### Build RestFul API Client using Spring WebClient and CompletableFuture

In this section, I will build a restful api client using Spring WebClient and Integrate with CompletableFuture to improve the performance of the api calls.

I will code and demonstrate how to use Spring WebClient to build a rest client

I will code and demonstrate the technique to integrate RestAPI calls with CompletableFuture to improve the overall performance of the code.

### Handle Multiple CompletableFutures - anyOf(), allOf()

In this section, I will code and explain about the techniques to handle multiple CompletableFutures.

I will code and explore the allOf() function thats part of the CompletableFuture API

I will code and explore the anyOf() function thats part of the CompletableFuture API

By the end of this course, you will have a complete understanding of ParallelStreams and CompletableFuture and how to use them in your projects.
